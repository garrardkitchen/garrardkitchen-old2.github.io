      <description>Coach migrated from MSSQL to MySQL as costs were too high for Always-On capabilities. I was accepted onto Aurora MySQL Preview programme and contributed to this phase. The product had a key dependency that required a specific version of MySQL. As a result we are now using Amazon Aurora and plan to migrate over to Aurora Serverless when version 5.7 is supported.
 To offer CXcoach to a greater audience, a web plug-in dependency had to be removed.</description>
