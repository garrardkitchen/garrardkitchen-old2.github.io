      <description>For the last 10+ years I&amp;rsquo;ve been a CTO for an exciting start-up. Recently that came to an abrupt and sad end. I will blog about the days and the efforts involved to keep the company afloat in the comming months and only when rawness of this fades. Great team, great vision, great imagination.
Today is a new start for me, day 1 if you will. With very little notice I have compiled this site to present the best side of me in order to become employed again.</description>
