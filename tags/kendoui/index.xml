      <description> Created a web based product of our successful client/server product. Chose appropriate tech to fit the timeline.
 Worked with a Pakistani development outsourcing company and Recorder vendor that the product was integrating with at the time. Later developing the application to integrate with the Redbox Recorder, leading Redbox to purchase the code after an agreed sign off.  </description>
