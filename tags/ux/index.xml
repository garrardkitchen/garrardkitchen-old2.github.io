      <description>Coach migrated from MSSQL to MySQL as costs were too high for Always-On capabilities. I was accepted onto Aurora MySQL Preview programme and contributed to this phase. The product had a key dependency that required a specific version of MySQL. As a result we are now using Amazon Aurora and plan to migrate over to Aurora Serverless when version 5.7 is supported.
 To offer CXcoach to a greater audience, a web plug-in dependency had to be removed.</description>

      <description>An important part of a SaaS application, especially one that requires integrations to provide any measure of benefit, is onboarding.
For me, the advantages are simple.

      <description>The CXcoach cloud based product needed a ‘face lift’.
I investigated the most frugal way to provide the product with a new look and feel, one that is aligned with industry expectations. I settled on an open source theme and provided my UX lead developer a branch of code that used this new theme for him to complete and fix any style and placement issues. For specific areas of the product (features), I provided the same person with a mock up (HTML and style) for him to incorporate into the React front-end.</description>
